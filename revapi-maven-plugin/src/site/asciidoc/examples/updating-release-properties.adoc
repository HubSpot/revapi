== Updating Versions In `release.properties`

NOTE: Goal details page: link:../update-release-properties-mojo.html[here]

This works identically to the link:update-versions.html[update versions goal] but instead of updating the version
directly in the `pom.xml` files, it creates or updates the `release.properties` file. This will then be read by the
maven release plugin during the release process.

Thus, running:

```
mvn revapi:update-release-properties && mvn release:prepare
```

will automatically set the release and development versions for you according to the http://semver.org[semver]
versioning rules.
