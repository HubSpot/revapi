== Reporting With Revapi

=== Report Per Module

NOTE: Goal details page: link:../report-mojo.html[here]

The Revapi Maven plugin offers the possibility to create simple reports of the API changes found in the analysis. The
link:../report-mojo.html[report goal] offers the same configuration properties as the analysis itself. Just include
the following snippet in `reporting/plugins` of your POM:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
    <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>...</version>
    <reportSets>
        <reportSet>
            <reports>
                <report>report</report>
            </reports>
        </reportSet>
    </reportSets>
    ...
</plugin>
```

The report can be configured in a very much the same way as the build-time API check and provides virtually the same
configuration properties.

=== Aggregate Report

NOTE: Goal details page: link:../report-aggregate-mojo.html[here]

For POM-packaged modules, one can create an aggregate report consisting of the individual reports of the modules that
are (indirectly) referenced by the POM module. Again this can be configured the same way the rest of the Revapi goals.
Please consult the details page of the goal for the individual configuration properties.

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
    <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>...</version>
    <reportSets>
        <reportSet>
            <reports>
                <report>report-aggregate</report>
            </reports>
        </reportSet>
    </reportSets>
    ...
</plugin>
```
