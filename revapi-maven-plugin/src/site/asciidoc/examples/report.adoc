== Reporting With Revapi

NOTE: Goal details page: link:../report-mojo.html[here]

The Revapi Maven plugin offers the possibility to create simple reports of the API changes found in the analysis. The
link:../report-mojo.html[report goal] offers the same configuration properties as the analysis itself. Just include
the following snippet in `reporting/plugins` of your POM:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
    <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>...</version>
    <reportSets>
        <reportSet>
            <reports>
                <report>report</report>
            </reports>
        </reportSet>
    </reportSets>
    ...
</plugin>

```
