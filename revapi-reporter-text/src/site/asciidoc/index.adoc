== Text Reporter

*Configuration Root*: `revapi.reporter.text`

This extension is used as a basic means of outputting the results of analysis as text to some file or standard output.

The format of the text can be configured using a http://freemarker.org[FreeMarker] template.

=== Usage

Revapi needs to be configured to use this extension, it is not present by default. In case of maven plugin, you need to
add the extension as a dependency of the maven plugin like so:
```xml
<build>
   ...
   <plugin>
      <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
      <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>...</version>
      <dependencies>
         <dependency>
            <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
            <artifactId>revapi-reporting-text</artifactId>
            <version>...</version>
         </dependency>
         ...
      </dependencies>
      <configuration>
      <analysisConfiguration><![CDATA[
         {
           "revapi": {
              "reporter": {
                 "text": {
                    ... configure the extension here ...
                 }
              }
           }
         }
      ]]></analysisConfiguration>
      </configuration>
   </plugin>
   ...
</build>
```

=== Sample Configuration

```javascript
{
  "revapi" : {
    "reporter" : {
      "text" : {
        "minSeverity": "POTENTIALLY_BREAKING",
        "output" : "out"
        "template": "my-template.ftl"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

=== Properties

`minSeverity`::
The minimum severity of problems that will be included in the output. If not specified, defaults to
`POTENTIALLY_BREAKING`. Possible values are `NON_BREAKING`, `POTENTIALLY_BREAKING` and `BREAKING`.
`output`::
The path to the output file. Two special values are recongized: `out` (which is the default value of this property) and
`err` which represent standard output or standard error output respectively.
`template`::
A relative path to a FreeMarker template to format the output with. If not specified a built-in simple template is used.

=== Example Template

This is actually the default template used by the extension if you don't configure your own template.

```ftl
<#list reports as report> <1>
old: ${report.oldElement!"<none>"}
new: ${report.newElement!"<none>"}
<#list report.differences as diff>
${diff.code}<#if diff.description??>: ${diff.description}</#if>
<#list diff.classification?keys as compat>${compat}: ${diff.classification?api.get(compat)}<#sep>, </#list> <2>
</#list>
<#sep>

</#sep>
</#list>
```
<1> The results of the analysis are made available to the template in the `reports` variable which is a list of
link:../revapi/apidocs/org/revapi/Report.html[`Report`] objects.
<2> The `classification` map of a difference uses an enum as a key. To be able to access the values by keys, one has to
use the `?api` construct and use the native method to access the value. Using `classification[compat]` is not possible
in the example above. This is a limitation of FreeMarker.

== FreeMarker Configuration

If you're going to use your custom template, you will need to how the FreeMarker configuration used for rendering the
template.

* The compatibility level is set to version `2.3.23`.
* The default object wrapper is used and is configured to expose public fields in addition to bean properties.
* The API built-ins are enabled (i.e. you can use ?api to access the methods of the underlying object).
* There are 2 template loaders:
** for templates from `/META-INF` using the classloader of the extension,
** for templates anywhere on the filesystem (either relative to the current path or using an absolute path) (note that
this is not the default FreeMarker's `FileTemplateLoader` which enforces some security restrictions useful in web
application environment but which are not desirable in our usecase).
