== Java Extension

The Java extension somewhat obviously provides API checking capability for Java libraries. It contains a large number
of checks that check different aspects of changes in the API, but it, too, is extensible. That is useful in cases where
Java methods are annotated using annotations like JPA or JAXB. One can imagine new checks on methods and fields
annotated by those annotations to perform additional analysis for DB schema changes or XML serialization changes.

=== SPI

The Java extension can be augmented through its small
link:../revapi-java-spi/apidocs/org/revapi/java/spi/package-summary.html[SPI] that declares a
link:../revapi-java-spi/apidocs/org/revapi/java/spi/Check.html[hook interface] into the java checking process that
represents the Revapi's API elements as Java's own
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/lang/model/package-summary.html[model elements]. The checking framework
then can use the Java plaform's own rich functionality for examining the classes in the checked libraries (note, that
this API is NOT the reflection API, because it actually doesn't load the library classes into Java runtime).

You can walk through the <<enhance-java-checks.adoc#, example Java check>> to see how to extend the Java checks.

=== Detected Differences
All the differences detected by the extension are defined in the
link:../revapi-java-spi/apidocs/org/revapi/java/spi/Code.html[Code] enumeration. Below, you can find a short discussion
of each type of the difference.

==== Missing API Class
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.missing.oldClass+ or +java.missing.newClass+
| Binary severity   | potentially breaking
| Source severity   | potentially breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

By default, Revapi will abort the API check if it encounters a type that should belong to the API but that cannot be
found neither in the API libraries themselves or in the supporting libraries. It can also be configured to ignore such
missing classes or to report them. If it is configured to report them, one of the above codes will be emitted
depending on whether the missing class is found in the old version of the API or the new one.

The missing class behavior can be configured by the `revapi.java.missing-classes` configuration property with the
possible values of `ignore`, `report` and `error`, e.g.:

[source,javascript]
----
{
    "revapi" : {
        "java" : {
            "missing-classes" : "report"
        }
    }
}

==== Element No Longer Deprecated
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.element.noLongerDeprecated+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

An element (class, method or field) is marked as deprecated in the old version of the API but not in the new version.
This represents no danger in terms of API breakage and is reported only because it is useful to know for the library
users to know about such cases.

==== Element Now Deprecated
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.element.nowDeprecated+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

An element (class, method or field) is marked as deprecated in the new version of the API but not in the old version.
This represents no danger in terms of API breakage and is reported only because it is useful to know for the library
users to know about such cases.

==== Class Visibility Increased
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.class.visibilityIncreased+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

The class is more visible in the new version of the API than it used to be in the old version. This is no API breakage
and is reported for completeness sake. The visibility is ordered as follows: +private+ < +package private+ < +protected+
< +public+.

==== Class Visibility Reduced
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.class.visibilityReduced+
| Binary severity   | breaking
| Source severity   | breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

Reducing the visibility of an API class is a breaking change. It means that classes that could inherit or use the class
might no longer be able to. Thus a library user might face compilation errors at compile time or linkage errors at
runtime when trying to use the new version of the library.

==== Class Kind Changed
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.class.kindChanged+
| Binary severity   | breaking
| Source severity   | breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

There are 4 kinds of java classes: +class+, +interface+, +annotation type+, +enum+. This difference is reported when
a class changes from one to the other. This is of course incompatible change and will break the library users at both
compile time and at runtime.

==== Class No Longer Final
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.class.noLongerFinal+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

A class that used to be final is now not. This is no API breakage and is reported for completeness sake.

==== Class Now Final
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.class.nowFinal+
| Binary severity   | breaking
| Source severity   | breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

A class became final in the new version of the library. This is a breaking change because any library user that extended
the class will no longer be compatible with the new version of the library, in which the class cannot be extended.

==== Class No Longer Abstract
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.class.noLongerAbstract+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

A class that used to be abstract is now not. This is no API breakage and is reported for completeness sake.

==== Class Now Abstract
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.class.nowAbstract+
| Binary severity   | breaking
| Source severity   | breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

A concrete class became abstract in the new version of the library. This is a breaking change because it is no longer
possible to create instances of such class.

==== Class Added
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.class.added+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

A new class appeared in the new version of the API. This is a non-breaking change reported for completeness sake.

==== Class Removed
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.class.removed+
| Binary severity   | breaking
| Source severity   | breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

A class present in the old version of the library is no longer present. This is of course a breaking change because
the users of the API will no longer be able to use that class in any capacity.

==== Class No Longer Implements Interface
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.class.noLongerImplementsInterface+
| Binary severity   | breaking
| Source severity   | breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

This is a breaking change because it is no longer possible to cast the class to the no longer implemented interface.

==== Class Now Implements Interface
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.class.nowImplementsInterface+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

No API breakage reported for the completeness sake.

==== Final Class Inherits From New Class
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.class.finalClassInheritsFromNewClass+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

A final class inherits from a new class. This represents no API breakage and is reported for completeness sake.
Inheriting from a new class may introduce new methods or fields to the class but cannot remove any (method changes are
reported separately).

==== Non-final Class Inherits From New Class
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.class.nonFinalClassInheritsFromNewClass+
| Binary severity   | potentially breaking
| Source severity   | potentially breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

While this change is usually OK, it might cause trouble to the users of the API if the newly inherited class contains
final methods. If the users of the library happen to define methods of the same name in the class that inherits from the
checked one, they will get compilation or linkage errors.

==== Class Now Checked Exception
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.class.nowCheckedException+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

A class newly inherits from +java.lang.Exception+. This is a source incompatibility because such exceptions need to be
declared in the +throws+ declarations of the methods.

==== Class No Longer Inherits From Class
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.class.noLongerInheritsFromClass+
| Binary severity   | breaking
| Source severity   | breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

The checked class no longer inherits from a super class that it used to. This means that it can no longer be cast to
that super class nor can the methods declared in the super class be called using the instance of the checked class.

==== Class Is Non-Public Part of API
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.class.nonPublicPartOfAPI+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | breaking
|=============

While this is non-breaking from the pure API compatibility point of view, it is a very strange design decision.
This means that a class that is not publicly accessible (i.e. is private or package private) is used in a public
capacity (i.e. return type of a method, type of a method parameter, type of an accessible field, implemented interface).

NOTE: This is NOT reported on a non-accessible class that is used solely as a super class of another API classes or that
is only implemented by other API classes. An implementation of a private interface or inheriting from a non-public
super class is a valid design decision.

==== Type Parameters of The Super Type Changed
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.class.superTypeTypeParametersChanged+
| Binary severity   | potentially breaking
| Source severity   | potentially breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

The checked class inherits from a generic class. The type parameters used on the generic super class changed between old
and new version. Because of type erasure, this might not cause any binary incompatibility (but it can) and it can
potentially break the compilation, too.

This is generally a quite dangerous thing to do, because it can change the erased signatures of the methods or fields
inherited from the super class (which would be the cause of the binary and source incompatibilities).

==== Annotation Added
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.annotation.added+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | potentially breaking
|=============

An element is newly annotated by given annotation. This poses no risk during compilation or at linkage time but may
cause semantic differences between the versions because of the way the annotations can be used (code generation,
processing, reflection, etc.).

==== Annotation Removed
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.annotation.removed+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | potentially breaking
|=============

An element is no longer annotated by given annotation. This poses no risk during compilation or at linkage time but may
cause semantic differences between the versions because of the way the annotations can be used (code generation,
processing, reflection, etc.).

==== Annotation Attribute Value Changed
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.annotation.attributeValueChanged+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | potentially breaking
|=============

An attribute of some annotation on some element changed its value. This poses no risk during compilation or at linkage
time but may cause semantic differences between the versions because of the way the annotations can be used (code
generation, processing, reflection, etc.).

==== Annotation Attribute Added
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.annotation.attributeAdded+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | potentially breaking
|=============

An annotation on some element newly specifies an explicit value of an attribute. This poses no risk during compilation
or at linkage time but may cause semantic differences between the versions because of the way the annotations can be
used (code generation, processing, reflection, etc.).

==== Annotation Attribute Removed
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.annotation.attributeRemoved+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | potentially breaking
|=============

An annotation on some element no longer specifies an explicit value of an attribute. This poses no risk during
compilation or at linkage time but may cause semantic differences between the versions because of the way the
annotations can be used (code generation, processing, reflection, etc.).

==== Annotation No Longer Inherited
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.annotation.noLongerInherited+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | potentially breaking
|=============

An annotation type used to be annotated with the `@Inherited` annotation but is no more. This poses no risk during
compilation or at linkage time but may cause semantic differences between the versions because of the way the
annotations can be used (code generation, processing, reflection, etc.).

==== Annotation Now Inherited
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.annotation.nowInherited+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | potentially breaking
|=============

An annotation type is now annotated with the `@Inherited` annotation. This poses no risk during
compilation or at linkage time but may cause semantic differences between the versions because of the way the
annotations can be used (code generation, processing, reflection, etc.).

==== Static Field Added
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.field.addedStaticField+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

No API breakage, provided for completeness sake. Note that this si reported only for publicly accessible fields.

==== Field Added
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.field.added+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

No API breakage, provided for completeness sake. Note that this si reported only for publicly accessible fields.

==== Field Removed
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.field.removed+
| Binary severity   | breaking
| Source severity   | breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

The field was removed from the class. This is an API breakage because the field can no longer be accessed.
Note that this si reported only for publicly accessible fields.

==== Constant Field Removed
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.field.removed+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | breaking
| Semantic severity | potentially breaking
|=============

An accessible static final field (i.e. a constant) was removed from the class. This breaks compilation but actually
causes no problem at runtime (i.e. when the new API is swapped for the old API without recompiling the users of the
API). This is because the constants are inlined during compilation. Because the value is no longer declared or used
in the API but the user of the API still can operate with the value, this is also reported as potentially breaking the
semantics.

==== Constant Field Changed Value
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.field.constantValueChanged+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | breaking
|=============

A constant field changed its value. At compilation time, the new value is used, but at runtime (i.e. when the new API is
swapped for the old API without recompiling the users of the API) the users of the API will still use the old value,
because the constant values are inlined. This is therefore reported as breaking the semantics.

==== Field Now Constant
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.field.nowConstant+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

This is no API breakage and is reported only for completeness' sake.

==== Field No Longer Constant
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.field.nowConstant+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | breaking
|=============

When compiling an API user against the new version of the API, the value of the field is taken. When swapping the new
version of the API for the old version of the API without recompiling the *old value* coming from the inlined constant
value from the old version of the API is used. I.e. the code works and therefore this is neither a source nor binary
incompatibility, but it is marked as a semantic incompatibility, because the behavior described above is most probably
NOT what the API author had in mind when making the change.

==== Field Now Final
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.field.nowFinal+
| Binary severity   | breaking
| Source severity   | breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

A field that could previously be assigned to is now final and cannot be changed. This is therefore both source and
binary incompatibility.

==== Field No Longer Final
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.field.noLongerFinal+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

This is no API breakage and is reported for completeness' sake.

==== Field No Longer Static
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.field.noLongerStatic+
| Binary severity   | breaking
| Source severity   | breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

A static field has become an instance field. Accessing the field is no longer possible through its class and therefore
this is both source and binary incompatibility.

==== Field Now Static
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.field.nowStatic+
| Binary severity   | breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

According to the Java specification, the Java runtime will throw `IncompatibleClassChangeError` when an instance field
has become static and the new version of API is used against the user code compiled against the old version of API.
When recompiling the user code against the new version, everything works fine.

==== Field Type Changed
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.field.typeChanged+
| Binary severity   | breaking
| Source severity   | breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

The field has a different type than it used to in the old version of the API. This is incompatible change.

==== Field `serialVersionUID` Unchanged
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.field.serialVersionUIDUnchanged+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | potentially breaking
|=============

This is reported on the `serialVersionUID` fields of classes that didn't change between the versions even though the
default UIDs would be different for the two versions of the the class. While this doesn't break the compilation nor does
it break binary compatibility, it possibly may cause semantic problems because serialization may misbehave. This
depends on if and how the `readObject` and `writeObject` methods on the class are implemented, which is beyond the scope
of this check.

==== Field Visibility Increased
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.field.visibilityIncreased+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking

|=============

No API breakage, reported for completeness' sake.

==== Field Visibility Reduced

|=============
| Code              | +java.field.visibilityReduced+
| Binary severity   | breaking
| Source severity   | breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

Field's visibility was reduced, which means that code that used to be able to access it might no longer be able to.

==== Enum Constant Order Changed
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.field.enumConstantOrderChanged+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | potentially breaking
|=============

The constants of an enumeration were re-ordered. This can lead to problems in user code that uses the `Enum.ordinal()`
method to determine the order of an enum constant and relies on a specific value.

==== Default Value Added To Method
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.method.defaultValueAdded+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

This is only relevant on annotation types, of which the attributes are represented by method declarations.
Declaring a default value to an annotation attribute is not an API breakage and is only reported for completeness' sake.

==== Method's Default Value Changed
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.method.defaultValueChanged+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | potentially breaking
|=============

This is only relevant on annotation types, of which the attributes are represented by method declarations.
Changing a default value is both source and binary compatible but might cause a semantic incompatibility (depending on
how the annotation is used). Elements annotated using this annotation that didn't provide an explicit value for this
attribute will suddenly be understood to have the new default value of the attribute when used with the new version of
the API. This might or might not be a problem.

==== Default Value Removed From Method
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.method.defaultValueRemoved+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | breaking
| Semantic severity | breaking
|=============

An annotation attribute no longer declares a default value. This is source incompatible change because elements
annotated without explicitly specifying the value for the attribute will no longer compile. This also breaks semantics
because annotation processor that relies on the new version of the annotation type will break with a user library that
was compiled against the old version of the API (and therefore didn't have to declare the default value of the
attribute).

==== Method Added To Interface
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.method.addedToInterface+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | breaking
| Semantic severity | potentially breaking
|=============

This is a source-incompatible change because all implementations that were written against the old version of the
interface will not have the implementation of the new method and therefore will not compile.

On contrary, this is binary compatible, because no code that used the old version of the interface could have called
the method through the interface. The linker doesn't check for missing method implementations so the linkage also goes
without a problem.

There might be semantic problems though. It might break in situations where the interface serves the purpose of an SPI -
a library declares an SPI interface to be implemented by users and then
uses these SPI implementations inside the library. If the new version of the library assumes that the SPI
implementations provide the impl of the new method and it is provided with the SPI implementation of the old version
of the interface, things will break with `NoSuchMethodError` when the caller tries to call the SPI method backed by the
old SPI implementation.

==== Method With No Default Value Added To Annotation Type
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.method.attributeWithNoDefaultAddedToAnnotationType+
| Binary severity   | non breaking

| Semantic severity | breaking
|=============

While technically a variant of <<method-added-to-interface, Method Added To Interface>>, this is similar in consequences
to <<default-value-removed-from-method, Default Value Removed From Method>>. This is not binary incompatible, there can
be no code compiled against the previous version of the API that would try to access or use the new attribute in any
way. This is source incompatible though, because any code that declares annotations according to the old version of the
API will fail to compile against the new version of the API because it will not define explicit value for the new
attribute. This also breaks semantics because any element annotated without such attribute won't be possible to process
using a processor that depends on the new version of the API and therefore assumes an explicit value for the annotation
attribute.

| Code              | +java.method.abstractMethodAdded+
| Binary severity   | breaking

Abstract method added to a class. All the code compiled against the old version of the API will not provide a concrete
implementation of it and will therefore break.

| Code              | +java.method.added+

As with <<final-method-added-to-non-final-class, Final Method Added To Non-final Class>>, this can break if a subclass
in user code overrides the method.

This is identical to <<method-removed, Method Removed>> but specialized for annotation types.

==== Method No Longer Final

| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

No API breakage, reported for completeness' sake.

Any subclasses that overrode the method will break both at compile time and at runtime.

==== Method No Longer Static

| Code              | +java.method.noLongerStatic+
| Binary severity   | breaking
| Source severity   | breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

When a method becomes a member method, it no longer can be called from the static context. This breaks both binary
and source compatibility.

==== Method Now Static
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.method.nowStatic+
| Binary severity   | breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

A static method can be called in the same way as member method, so on the source level, this change is compatible.
It is not binary compatible though because static methods are called using a different bytecode instruction.

==== Method Visibility Increased
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.method.visibilityIncreased+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

No API breakage, reported for completeness' sake.

==== Method Visibility Reduced

|=============
| Code              | +java.method.visibilityIncreased+
| Binary severity   | breaking
| Source severity   | breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

A method might no longer be visible to code that used to call it. This is a breaking change.

==== Method Return Type Changed
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.method.returnTypeChanged+
| Binary severity   | breaking
| Source severity   | potentially breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

While changing the return type always breaks at runtime (i.e. when swapping the new API for the old API without
recompiling the user code), it might be OK at compile time due to implicit conversions of primitive types.

==== Type Parameters of The Return Type Changed
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.method.returnTypeTypeParametersChanged+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

If the return type of the method is a generic type and its type parameters change between old and new version of the API
it is a source incompatible change. It is binary compatible because of type erasure.

==== Number of Method Parameters Changed
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.method.numberOfParametersChanged+
| Binary severity   | breaking
| Source severity   | breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

Obviously, this is a breaking change - you can no longer call the method with the same parameters.

==== Method Parameter Type Changed
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.method.parameterTypeChanged+
| Binary severity   | breaking
| Source severity   | potentially breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

This is a binary incompatibility but may be source compatible if the changed types are primitive and the new one
is strictly bigger than the old one and the old one is implicitly convertible to it.

==== Element Now Parameterized
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.generics.elementNowParameterized+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | non breaking
| Semantic severity | potentially breaking
|=============

In and of itself, this is a compatible change but may cause semantic confusion if the user code compiled against the old
API wasn't honoring the new semantics introduced with the generic type parameter (e.g. old code was using raw `List` and
the new version of the API parameterized the list to `List<E>`. The old code used to insert variety of types into the
list but the new version of the API suggests it is not possible. Everything will still work correctly, but new user code
might start assuming uniform types in the list).

==== Formal Type Parameter Added
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.generics.formalTypeParameterAdded+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

This is not a binary incompatibility due to type erasure but it is a source incompatible change. Classes declared
against the old version of the API will no longer compile with the new version because they will be missing the
definition of the formal type parameter.

==== Formal Type Parameter Removed
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.generics.formalTypeParameterRemoved+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

This is not a binary incompatibility due to type erasure but it is a source incompatible change. Classes declared
against the old version of the API will no longer compile with the new version because they will be declaring a type
parameter that is no longer required.

==== Formal Type Parameter Changed
[cols="35s,<65d"]
|=============
| Code              | +java.generics.formalTypeParameterChanged+
| Binary severity   | non breaking
| Source severity   | breaking
| Semantic severity | NA
|=============

The constraints on the formal type parameter have changed. This is again source incompatible because the user code
declared against the old version of the API will use wrong constraints.
