== Annotated Element Filter

*Configuration Root*: `revapi.java.filter.annotated`

The annotated element filter is able to include or exclude java elements based on the presence of certain annotation
on them. This also works for annotations with certain attributes having certain values, because the match is done on
the "standard" annotation notation.

=== Sample Configuration

```javascript
{
  "revapi": {
    "java": {
      "filter": {
        "annotated": {
          "regex": false,
          "exclude": ["@java.lang.Deprecated"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
