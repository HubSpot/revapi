== Building
Revapi is a mavenized project so to download it and build it you merely need to call

 git clone https://github.com/metlos/revapi.git
 cd revapi
 mvn install

Of course, there are some slight gotchas... ;)

=== Building the site
The site is not the part of the default build because it is not part of the codebase per se, but more importantly
because it is written using http://awestruct.org[awestruct] and as such requires installed awestruct to build
successfully. This is not something people usually have set up on their machines so you have to build the site by
explicitly going into its module directory and call

 mvn site

This will invoke awestruct build from inside maven and the site will be located in the target directory.
