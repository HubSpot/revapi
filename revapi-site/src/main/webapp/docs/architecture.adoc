== Architecture

Revapi has a very simple architecture consisting of a simple linear pipeline that processes a "forest" (a set of trees)
of individual API elements.

The API elements come from archives. As of now, the only possible source of archives is the file system (future versions
of Revapi may introduce other implementations for different sources of archives).

A set of archives containing the old version of API is passed to an archive analyzer that produces a forest of API
elements. Then archives of the new version are analyzed the same way.

The two API forests are then consistently sorted and traversed in parallel. New or missing elements are detected and
equivalent elements are compared using an element analyzer, producing a set of reports that contain the differences
found while comparing the elements. The differences are then simply reported.

The following diagram depicts the work flow graphically.

Each of the stages in that work flow is configurable. The configuration is supplied as JSON files, that are validated
against JSON schemas that each extension can supply.

== Extension points

The diagram above hints at several extension points available in Revapi.

=== Archives
An link:../apidocs/org/revapi/Archive.html[archive] is a very simple abstraction over a file that represents the
archive containing some API elements (like Java's jar archive or a class file, an XML document, properties file, etc).

Revapi actually doesn't provide any implementation of it on its own (only the standalone Revapi's CLI contains a private
implementation able to read from files) but it is trivial to implement one.

=== API Analyzer
An link:../apidocs/org/revapi/ApiAnalyzer.html[API analyzer] (which is kinda implicit in the diagram) is the main
interface for implementing API checks for custom "language". It provides and configures the analyzers of the archives
and API difference analyzers both to be detailed below.

=== Archive Analyzer
An link:../apidocs/org/revapi/ArchiveAnalyzer.html[archive analyzer] is instantiated and configured by the API
analyzer to analyze archives of a version of API. It represents the results of the analysis as an
link:../apidocs/org/revapi/ElementForest.html[element forest] (i.e. a set of element trees).

=== Element Filter
An link:../apidocs/org/revapi/ElementFilter.html[element filter] can filter out elements from the element forest
before they are passed further down the API analysis pipeline. The same set of element filters is applied to both the
old API and new API element forests.

=== Difference Analyzer
The magic happens in the link:../apidocs/org/revapi/DifferenceAnalyzer.html[difference analyzers]. Revapi
simultaneously traverses the two element forests discovering new or removed elements and matching the comparable
elements in them (using a link:../apidocs/org/revapi/CoIterator.html[coiterator]). It then passes the matched
pairs to the difference analyzer that performs the actual analysis of changes and provides the reports summarizing them.

=== Difference Transform
Once the differences are found they are supplied to the
link:../apidocs/org/revapi/DifferenceTransform.html[difference transforms]. These extensions can, as the name
suggests, transform the found differences into different ones or altogether remove them from the results.

=== Reporter
Finally, after the final set of differences is settled, it is passed to the
link:../apidocs/org/revapi/Reporter.html[reporters]. These are responsible to report the found differences to the
caller somehow (standard output, database, xml files, whatever one imagines).
