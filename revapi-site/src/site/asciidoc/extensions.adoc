== Extensions

Revapi has been written in extensibility in mind. Everything from API scanning, filtering to report generation is
extensible. Revapi comes with a couple of extensions that make it useful without a need to write any code yourself
(even though writing an extension is super simple and fun ;) ).

This is a collection of the most basic and rudimentary extensions that make the work with an evolving API useful.
Included are extensible filtering, reclassification of found problems, etc.

== link:modules/revapi-java/index.html[Java Extension]
Revapi itself is written in Java so it would be strange for it not to have a Java API checker. The java extension is
just that - a full featured Java API checker checking both source and binary compatibility and even some hints of
behavioral compatibility (veeery simple so far - don't get too excited ;) ).
