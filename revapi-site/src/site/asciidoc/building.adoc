== Building
Revapi is a mavenized project so to download it and build it you merely 
need to call

 git clone https://github.com/revapi/revapi.git
 cd revapi
 mvn install

Of course, there are some slight gotchas... ;)

=== Building the site

The site is not the part of the default build because it is not part of 
thecodebase per se, but more importantly because it is written using 
http://awestruct.org[awestruct] and as such requires installed awestruct to 
build successfully. This is not something people usually have set up on 
their machines.

 mvn -Psite site

This will invoke awestruct build from inside maven and the site will be 
located in the target directory.
