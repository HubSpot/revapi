== Ignore Transformation

*Configuration Root*: `revapi.ignore`

Using this extension one can ignore certain API problems found during the analysis so that they don't appear in the
reported output.

=== Sample Configuration

```javascript
{
  "revapi" : {
    "ignore" : [
      {
        "regex" : false,
        "code" : "PROBLEM_CODE",
        "old" : "FULL_REPRESENTATION_OF_THE_OLD_ELEMENT",
        "new" : "FULL_REPRESENTATION_OF_THE_NEW_ELEMENT",
        "justification": "free form text to justify why this change was necessary"
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

=== Properties

`regex`::
If `true` (the default is `false`), the `code`, `old` and `new` values are understood to be java regular expressions.
`code`::
Specifies the API problem code to ignore. This is property mandatory.
`old`::
Specifies the old element of the problem to ignore. This property is optional.
`new`::
Specifies the new element of the problem to ignore. This property is optional.
`justification`::
This can used to describe why this change was necessary and hence why it should be ignored by the API checker.
